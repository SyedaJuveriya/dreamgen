# DreamGen 🎬

DreamGen is an AI-powered prototype that transforms text-based ideas into short video previews.  
It demonstrates how generative AI can simplify video creation by allowing users to describe a scene in natural language and receive a visual output.

This project was built as a prototype for the **AI for Good Hackathon**.

---

## 🚀 Problem Statement
Creating videos requires time, tools, and technical skills. Many creators, educators, and small teams struggle to quickly convert ideas into visual content.

---

## 💡 Solution
DreamGen provides a simple web interface where users:
1. Enter a text description of a video idea  
2. Click **Generate Video**  
3. View a generated video preview  

The current version uses a placeholder video to demonstrate the end-to-end flow.  
In future versions, this will be replaced with real AI-generated video models.

## ✨ Features
- Text-based video idea input
- Simple and clean UI
- End-to-end video generation flow
- Hackathon-ready prototype

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit (Frontend)
- Generative AI (planned)
- Snowflake (planned for metadata, prompts, and analytics)

---

## ▶ How to Run the Project

1. Install Streamlit:
```bash
pip install streamlit
```
2. Run the app
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```
3.Open the browser at:
http://localhost:8501

##🔮 Future Scope

- Integration with real AI video generation APIs (e.g., Runway Gen-2)

- Prompt history and analytics using Snowflake

- User authentication and saved projects

- Ethical AI safeguards for content generation

##📌 Note

This is a prototype created for demonstration purposes.
The current video output is a placeholder to showcase functionality and user flow.
